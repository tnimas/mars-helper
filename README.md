This is a browser-based tool for strategy [mars2025.net](http://mars2025.net "browser game mars2025"). 
Concurrently, an extension to the browser chrome.

You can [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/npfcldnmldgoemkcafnbcfmpjdgbecdi) it from Chrome Web Store.

At present she is doing 3 things:
- Notice of attacks on your virtual country
- Status icon in toolbar - shows your presence in the game
- Shows the important  data on the state of the countries reports.

You can also donate a few bucks to compensate for the cost of placing the application in chrome web storage
