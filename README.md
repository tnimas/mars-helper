# Mars Helper

This is a chrome extension for a browser strategy [mars2025.net](http://mars2025.net "browser game mars2025"). 

You can [install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/npfcldnmldgoemkcafnbcfmpjdgbecdi) it from Chrome Web Store.

For now it is doing 3 things:
- Notify about attacks on your virtual country.
- Shows your presence in the game through status icon in toolbar.
- Shows an important statistic data in spy and advicer pages.

You can donate a few bucks to compensate for the cost of placing the application in chrome web storage
